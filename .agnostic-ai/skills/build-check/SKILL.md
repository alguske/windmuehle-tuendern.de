Use when the user says "build check", "does it build", "verify build", "is the site building", "compile the site", or invokes /build-check. Auto-trigger after any edit to templates, sass, content, config.toml, or data/*.toml when the user wants to confirm the site still builds.

# Build Check

Run `zola build` from the project root and report the result.

## Steps

1. `zola build`
2. If it succeeds, report `Build passed` with the page count summary Zola prints (`Creating N pages and M sections`).
3. If it fails, show the offending error lines, identify the file and line if Zola reports them, and suggest the fix.

## When to fail loudly

- Tera template errors (missing keys, bad syntax, type mismatch).
- Frontmatter parse errors.
- Missing translation key referenced by `trans(key=..., lang=...)`.
- Broken internal links or shortcodes.

If the error is opaque, re-run with `RUST_LOG=debug zola build 2>&1 | tail -50` for more context.
